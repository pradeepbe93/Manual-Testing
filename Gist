What are gists
Now that we have a good understanding of repositories, we can review gists. Similarly to repositories, gists are a simplified way to share code snippets with others.

Every gist is a Git repository, which you can fork and clone and can be either public or secret.

Public gists are displayed publicly where people can browse new ones as they’re created. Public gists are also searchable.

Conversely, secret gists are not searchable, but they aren’t entirely private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it.

To learn more about gists see the linked article in our Resources section at the end of this module titled, Creating Gists
