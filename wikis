What are wikis?
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.

You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles.

While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.

Itâ€™s worth a reminder that if your repository is private only people who have at least read access to your repository will have access to your wiki.
